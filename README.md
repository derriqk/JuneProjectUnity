This is a repository where I recreate simple games on Unity to gain some experience

How it works:

<pre>
  Title Screen:
    Current Options:
      Play

  By clicking play, it brings user to whole page of games implemented, clicking that button sends them to that game scene

</pre>

Current games:
<ul>
  <li>TicTacToe</li>
</ul>
